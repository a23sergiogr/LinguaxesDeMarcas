    <h1><strong>Chaco Golden Knee Tarantula</strong></h1>
    <h2><em>Grammostola pulchripes</em></h2>
</head>
<body>
    <p>The Chaco golden knee is a large tarantula, being able to reach between 7 and 8 inches in legspan (17.8-20.3 cm). 
        Being a terrestrial tarantula, it has a heavy body. Mature males have longer legs and smaller bodies than females, 
        and they possess tibial hooks or apophyses to hold back a female's fangs during mating. 
        Males also possess modified pedipalps to insert sperm into the female's genital operculum. 
        It exhibits a multitude of colors, with bright yellowish leg stripes, dark black "femurs", 
        and pink hairs all over its body. As with the rest of the genus Grammostola, the Chaco golden knee has very large fangs, 
        and the carapace (the top of the prosoma) is raised to make room for the large chelicerae. It has rudimentary eyesight, 
        and senses its environment with the setae all over its body, feeling vibrations through the ground and air, and picking up chemical signatures,
         similar to a sense of smell.</p>
